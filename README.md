## Euclid's Algorithm
**Goal**: Find the Greatest Common Divisor from 2 given numbers.


**Main idea**: Euclidâ€™s great insight was that the greatest common divisor of
x and y must also be the greatest common divisor of y and the
remainder of x divided by y.

```
function gcd_euclid(x, y) {
	while (x % y !== 0) {
		var r = x % y;
		x = y;
		y = r;
	}
	 return y;
}
```
